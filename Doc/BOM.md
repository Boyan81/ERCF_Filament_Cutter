| 1   | **180Â°** Servo MR996             | That's just the servo I use, nothing special. But the MG90S are definetly too weak. Make sure the servo has a rotation distance of **180 Degree!** Also check the torque, u/BioKeks was't able to cut soft PLA with a 12kg.cm servo |
| 1   | 5V buck converter                | Prevents the ERCF board shutdown caused by the servo's high current draw. Can be wired to the PSU or used with a dedicated 5V PSU.                                                                                                   |
| 1   | Exacto knife blade No. 11        | Example shape/type for reference. Higher quality blades are recommended for longer-lasting performance.                                                                                                                              |
| -   | Wire to extend servo motor cable | Use any cable you have on hand to extend the servo wire, as it is too short. Ensure the wire can handle the peak current of the servo motor.                                                                                         |
| -   | Zip ties                         | Just the same zip ties you used during the ERCF assembly.                                                                                                                                                                            |
