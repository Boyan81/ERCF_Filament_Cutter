# Beta6 Changes ðŸ¥•

- Helical gearing with a higher module to prevent slipping
From my testing the gears work a lot better then the Beta 5 ones, had not a single slip during my testing 
- Moved servo a bit up to fix issue #8
The new ERCFV2 Encoder changed a bit compared to the original Binky, this required a repositioning of the gears. 
- Added lock nut to the pivot to prevent the screw to be loosened over time
- Made whole construction stronger to prevent flexing
- Improved knife mounting
I'm still not sure about this one, feel free to give your honest opinion about this https://github.com/kevinakasam/ERCF_Filament_Cutter/issues/6
- Made transition between encoder and arm smoother
- Adjusted mounting to be rotated up to 100 degree when loosened
- Improved ECAS mount
- Moved heated insert of encoder 4.5a slightly inward to prevent breaking
- Added some washers
- Added carrot ðŸ¥•
- New Logo
